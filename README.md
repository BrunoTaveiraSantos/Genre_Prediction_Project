# Genre_Prediction_Project

This was my final project at the data analytics bootcamp at iron hack.

I developed a WebApp, in which, using machine learning, it is possible to upload a song either by a file or recording and the algorithm returns the genre of the song.

I also developed an album cover generator, in which I trained the model with more than 800 album covers.

The methods used are the CNN and GANS models.

The datasets were more than 1000 songs of 30 seconds each of various genres and I made webscrape of more than 5000 album covers.
